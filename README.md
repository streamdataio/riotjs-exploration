# riotjs-explore

This project aims to explore [Riot.js](https://muut.com/riotjs/) a powerful micro-library with custom-tags, eventing and routing.

Most of the code is related to the blog posts series [« Exploring Riot.js »](http://streamdata.io/blog/tag/riot/).

Most of the projects uses npm. If you don't have npm yet, we advice you to install it with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), a really nice tool that can manage several npm versions. Once installed, run:

- `npm install`
- `npm run serve`  (live-edit)

A browser should be opened at: `http://localhost:3000/`
